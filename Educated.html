            <p> 
               Writen by American author Tara Westover, published by Random House. Westover recounts overcoming her survivalist Mormon family in order to go to college, and emphasizes the importance of education to enlarging her world. She details her journey from her isolated life in the mountains of Idaho to completing a PhD program in history at Cambridge University. She started college at the age of seventeen after having had no formal education. She also explores her struggle to fit into the larger world beyond what her radical survivalist father had created.

                <br>This memoir is told in three parts and consists of 40 chapters in total. The first part describes Tara Westover's life from her birth on Buck's Peak, a mountain in rural Idaho, until she was accepted at Brigham Young University (BYU). This part told us more about her family background and how was her life affected by her parents decision to live in isolation. Her father was paranoid about hospitals, the public school system, and the government, due in part to the 1992 events of Ruby Ridge. Tara's attempts to attend school or seek other normality in her life were denied by her father. She also got physically abused by her brother, Shawn. While her other brother, Tyler encouraged her to leave home, to take the ACT in order to apply to Brigham Young University. Westover was admitted to BYU and given a scholarship.</br>
                <br>Part two covers Westover's studies at BYU and her opportunity to study at King's College, Cambridge and receives financial awards that will allow her to remain there. She describes the stress she felt from the pressure of having to maintain her grades in order to keep her scholarship, as well as the issues she runs into due to her alienation from the outside world and lack of formal schooling. She also begins to question the abuse she continues to receive from both her father and Shawn.</br> 
                <br>In Part three, Westover writes about her life in Cambridge and after completing her PhD. She makes more steps into the world, getting all the vaccinations her family rejected. She occasionally returns to Buck's Peak, where she learns that Shawn is still abusing Emily.</br>
